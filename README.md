# Random Bits of Documenation about Running Electronic Computing Machines

This repository contains notes of the I Should Have Written This Down
Last Time variety. They are entirely random, entirely subjective, and may
or may be correct, helpful, secure, or reasonable. You have been warned.

Note that unless otherwise stated, these notes assume running a Debian
stable of whenever they were written.
